    <h1>Jamie Oliver</h1>

    <p class="colored" >Jamie Oliver, (born May 27, 1975, Clavering, Essex, England), British chef who achieved worldwide
        fame.Oliver’s parents were owners of a pub-restaurant in Clavering, Essex.
        After persistently begging the chefs to let him assist, he was allowed to work in the kitchen. At age 16 Oliver
        entered the Westminster Catering College before traveling to France for additional training and experience. He
        landed his first job in London at the Neal Street Restaurant as head pastry chef and soon began working as sous-chef
        at the River Café, where his talent in front of the camera was discovered during the filming of a documentary on the
        restaurant.</p>

    <h2>Jamie Oliver's television shows and books</h2>

    <p class="colored">Exploding onto the televised cookery scene with The Naked Chef in 1999, Oliver quickly established himself as a
        fresh, vibrant onscreen presence and his television shows and books, such as Happy Days with the Naked Chef and The
        Return of the Naked Chef all emphasise the fun, social aspect of whipping up a tasty dish for a group of friends.
        Before long Oliver had branched out into volumes on national cuisine, bringing the same sense of exuberance and
        enthusiasm to Jamie’s Italy, Jamie’s America and Jamie Does… as he did to domestic recipes. Cementing his place as
        the country’s best loved chef, Jamie’s 30 Minute Meals became the fast-selling non-fiction book of all time, upon
        publication in 2010, and was followed two years later by Jamie’s 15 Minute Meals. His unparalleled ability to
        encourage the nation to cook quick and easy, yet delicious, meals is also in evidence in more recent publications,
        such as Everyday Super Food, 5 Ingredients and Veg.</p>
